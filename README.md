Deep Thought Ãœber-Computer
===========

Basically a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference. It's pretty simple. The main tricky part was that the built-in Date( ) object for JavaScript only can go a couple hundred thousand years into the future, so I made a custom BigDate( ) object that can handle larger dates. In theory, the timer could count down for the full 7.5 million years without any further input on my part.
